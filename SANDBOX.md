# Sandbox Use Cases

Have a cloned project repo which contains schema.

Want to deploy schema within project checkout.
Want to make local changes and apply them to local DB for testing without committing to repo.

Don't want tool automatically performing a partial checkout
Don't want to have two step migrations for sandbox

Need a sandbox config which defines path to schema so that git actions aren't required
